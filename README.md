A faceted diamond with realistic light refraction

Multiple small support rings to stabilize the diamond

A stepped seating system so the diamond’s tip sits safely inside the ring

Geometry arranged to avoid the diamond tip entering the finger area

A blend of engineering design + beginner-friendly Blender modelling

This repository is meant for learning, showcasing progress, and sharing a reusable 3D asset.
