## Description

This project showcases:

- A gold ring base  
- A faceted diamond with transmission/IOR for realistic refraction  
- Multiple small support rings and prongs to stabilize the stone  
- A stepped seating system so the diamond’s tip sits safely inside the ring  
- Geometry arranged to avoid the diamond tip entering the finger area

This repo is intended for learning, showcasing progress, and sharing a reusable 3D asset.
